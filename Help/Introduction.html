        <h1>Welcome to PyPA</h1>
        <p>PyPA is a powerful desktop application designed to automate processes and make your workflows more efficient. With PyPA, you can write your own scripts, store them securely, and execute them on a schedule. It also offers robust debugging tools to assist in the development process.</p>
        
        <p>Through the <span class="highlight" style="color: #00A6FB;">Control Room</span>, you can monitor each script execution in real-time. This allows you to track and manage every item processed in your task queue. After each execution, a detailed log is generated, which can be easily downloaded for further analysis.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond scripting, PyPA enables you to create visual <span class="highlight">Diagrams</span> and store them in a centralized repository. This makes it easy to manage and share your work with others. For those who prefer a no-code approach, the integrated <span class="highlight" style="color: red;">Ryven</span> tool allows you to design and store code visually without writing a single line.</p>
        
        <p>If you have multiple computers on the same local network or VPN, PyPA can transform them into nodes that are accessible for remote command execution. This feature is perfect for distributed task management and ensures seamless operation across different systems.</p>
        
        <p>Your security is our priority. All your data, including passwords and sensitive information, is encrypted to ensure safety. PyPAâ€™s <span class="highlight" style="color: greenyellow;">Security</span> module provides comprehensive protection, so you can focus on your work without worrying about potential threats.</p>
