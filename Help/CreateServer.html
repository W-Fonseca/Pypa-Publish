        <h2>What is Create Server?</h2>
        <p>The Create Server feature allows you to generate an executable file that, when run on a machine within the same network, makes it capable of receiving commands and executing processes via the scheduler. This is especially useful for automating tasks and managing distributed systems without manual intervention.</p>

    <div class="content2">
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>       
        <ul class="list-items">
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Executable Generation:</strong></a>
                Create Server generates an executable file that must be run on the target machine.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Pre-Configuration:</strong></a>
                The machine must be pre-configured with Python installed to run the scripts that the scheduler will point to at the scheduled times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Task Execution:</strong></a>
                Once configured, the machine will be ready to handle automated tasks, respond to commands, and maintain continuous operation within your network.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <a>Click on <strong>Create Server</strong> and wait for the loading to complete.</a>

        <a>Once finished, it will indicate the folder where the terminal server was created.</a>
        <img src="Images/CreateServer_Finish.png" alt="Finish">
        <a>Copy the folder to the desired computer and execute it.</a>
        <img src="Images/Terminal-Server_FolderInstall.png" alt="Installation Finish">
        <a>Now you have a service machine that will execute tasks and receive commands.</a>
