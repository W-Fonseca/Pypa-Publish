    <div class="content">
        <h2>What is WorkQueue?</h2>
        <p>WorkQueue is a work queue that stores tasks or work items that need to be processed. It allows tasks to be managed efficiently, ensuring that they are executed in the correct order and prioritized as necessary.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content2">
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-items">
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Creation and Management:</strong></a>
                In Pypa, you can create new work queues and manage existing ones. This includes adding, editing, and deleting queues, as well as monitoring the status of tasks within each queue.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Process Decoupling:</strong></a>
                Using WorkQueues helps decouple complex processes, allowing different parts of a process to be executed independently and asynchronously.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Efficiency and Scalability:</strong></a>
                Increases the efficiency, scalability, and resilience of automations, ensuring that tasks are processed optimally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="highlight-blue"><strong>Monitoring and Prioritization:</strong></a>
                Allows monitoring task progress and prioritizing those that are most urgent, ensuring that critical items are processed first.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Example</h2>
        <p>Imagine a document approval process. Each document to be approved is an item in the work queue. The system can prioritize urgent documents and ensure they are processed first, while other documents wait in the queue.</p>
